A "person" represents 1000 beings, symbolized by a single figure in the city screen (see City Population).

· Maximum City Population:  
    Some races are less tolerant of crowding than others.  
    Their cities have lower maximum population sizes as follows:  
        trolls and dark elves have four fewer people per city;  
        dwarves have three fewer people per city;  
        draconians, gnolls, high elves and klackons each have two fewer people per city than "normal."  
· Population Growth Rates:  
    Races have different population growth rates.  
    Normal population growth rates depend mostly on the difference between the maximum size of a city and its current population.  
    The larger this difference, the faster a city grows.  
    The population growth rate can be found on the city screen in parenthesis after the actual population.  
    Of the races, draconians, gnolls, klackons and nomads have slow growth rates;  
    dark elves, dwarves, high elves and trolls have the slowest growth rates of all the races.  
    Lizardmen have fast growth rates;  
    barbarians have the fastest growth rates of all.  
    Outpost growth rates reflect the abilities of races to establish new cities.  
    While not identical to population growth rates, outpost growth rates roughly correspond to the races’ population growth rates.

The information provided on each city includes  
    the city’s name,  
    the race of the occupants,  
    the population size,  
    gold production per turn,  
    production points per turn,  
    the structure or troops currently being built  
    and the length of time to complete the current project.

The surveyor’s information includes statistics for a potential city built on the selected map square:  
the potential maximum population of a city built at that site  
and any bonuses such a city would get to its production and gold revenue because of nearby terrain features.

The Hamlet and the City Screen

As cities increase in size (population), their appearance in the main movement view changes appropriately.  

CITY POPULATION

Across the top row of your hamlet are small figures representing theinhabitants.  
The inhabitants of the city are generally productive and either spend their days farming or working in some other capacity.  
The number of people who farm are shown on the left, while the workers are congregating on the right.  

The minimum number of people necessary to produce enough food (by farming) to feed all the inhabitants of the city are automatically sectioned off on the left side of the population row.  
These farmers cannot be turned into workers; however, they do contribute to the production of the city (producing half as many production points as workers; see Resources).  
The rest of the population is composed of workers, who are automatically assigned non-farming jobs in order to keep productivity high.

CITY SIZE
Cities are named according to the number of inhabitants, as indicated on the following table.  
City Name   Population
Hamlet       1–4
Village      5–8
Town         9–12
City        13–16
Capital     17–25

In addition to feeding townsfolk and troops, potential food production has an impact on the growth rate of the population.  
The greater the difference between the number of people in a town and the total number of people that can be fed in the city, the faster its growth rate.  
This growth rate is further modified by the type of race in the city (some races naturally reproduce more quickly than others; see Select Race) and various city enchantments.

THE OUTPOST

To build a new city, you first have to go to the production screen in one of your other cities (see City Screen) and click on the settlers button.  
When you have constructed a settlers unit (note that it "costs" a townsperson to build this unit), decide on the best location for your new city.  
Spend some time examining the terrain in areas that are clear of other towns.  
The terrain types within two map squares of a city map square (specifically, all the squares except for the four corner squares in the 5X5 area centered around the city) determine the maximum population for the city and the special resources available to the city;  
a synopsis of a city’s potential on a selected map square is accessible via the surveyor button.  
See the Surveyor, Terrain and Terrain Specials sections for relevant information.  
Note that you can only build new cities on map squares that are at least three map squares away from all other cities on the same world.  
If you start a new city only three map squares away from another city, however, the map squares that both cities share (as a result of being built so close together) yield only 50% of their output to each city.  
Land that is shared is demarcated in the city map window of the city screen by a red 1/2 in the shared map squares.  
When you have selected a suitable site for a new city, send your settlers to that map square and select the build option.  
The settlers then quickly build an outpost (which you get to name) and populate it (i.e., the settlers disappear).  
The outpost starts with one population unit that is one-tenth of the size of a normal city population unit.  
The outpost has to grow to contain ten such "mini" population units before it expands into a hamlet.  
Right-clicking on an outpost displays the outpost window.  
This window has slots for ten houses.  
Each house that is filled in represents one mini-population unit.  
Grayed-out houses are empty, and the number of empty houses indicates how many more residents the outpost must acquire before it becomes a hamlet.
