in Eval Move Path
¿ if no units in the army have a status of going-to, then the Combat_Path_Value flag is meaningless ?
¿ which means the Stop_Short flag is meaning less ?
But, then what happens when you are moving one space onto an enemy/lair?
That whole block just cancels the Go-To and then maybe stops the path short of the combat target square
...
computer player doesn't have go-to?
computer player handles go-to + combat differently, elsewhere?
stopping short is just for handling go-to
 - it uses the combat flag to decide to stop short, but unsets it because stopping short means it doesn't enter combat

OVL_Action_Structure is Lair Index or City Index
attackee_idx = Obstacle_Value is Player Index for Lair/City or Unit Index
OVL_Action_Type is 0 for Unit, 1 for City, 5 for Lair
So, ...
    no good reason for storing the attackee_idx and OVL_Action_Structure differently?
per the code structure they belong to different parts of the code?

Combat and Spell Casting
Combat

The spell information window is devoted to statistical information on your wizard’s spell casting abilities for the current combat.
...
Range is a distance modifier for the cost of casting spells in battles that are far from the wizard’s enchanted fortress (see Spells in Combat).

SPELLS IN COMBAT
...

Spells cast during combat generally cost more than they would if they were cast overland.
Because a wizard’s power base is situated in his or her enchanted fortress, battles often require a wizard to “channel” magic power for casting spells from this power base to a remote battle location.
This channeling process is very wasteful of mana
  (except for Channelers, see Special Abilities),
  and the farther away the battlefield is from the enchanted fortress, the more expensive casting combat spells becomes.
The basic rules are that
 1) when battles take place within five map squares of the wizard’s enchanted fortress, combat spells do not cost extra, and
 2) the maximum a combat spell can cost is three times its normal casting cost.
The actual casting cost multiplier for spells cast during the combat is shown in the spell information window (see Combat) next to the word “Range”.
Example: A range of 1x (times one) means that you spend no additional mana when casting a combat spell.
If the modifier shows a 2x (times two), you reduce the skill number for this battle by the mana cost of the spell,
  but extract double the mana from your mana reserve, due to the distance penalty representing the mana wasted by channeling.

A wizard’s spell casting skill limits how much total magic power the wizard can use to cast spells during combat.
However, the extra mana that it costs to cast a spell because of the distance of the battlefield from the wizard’s fortress does not count toward that limit
  (it is merely charged as a penalty against his or her mana reserves).
