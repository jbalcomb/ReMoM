Meh?

various functions populate an in/out of a units array with a units array count

not quite "stack", in that they do not use the struct / do not have a 'status' {active,inactive}

maybe wp, maybe in-tower

dead or own_idx == -1

city_idx vs/ {wx,wy,wp}

player_idx vs. ~player_idx




// WZD o59p03
void Get_Units_City(int16_t city_idx, int16_t * unit_count, int16_t unit_array[])
