¿ looks like FLIC Frames, but nothing looks like width, height etc. ?
¿ 1st has a 1A which seems to offset correctly to what looks like FLIC Frame Data, but that'd mean the offset was from BoF, which would be incongruent ?
same in HELP_LBX_001
So, "Library Data" has a header of 0x1A 26 bytes?
    seems so - the offsets are relative to the LBX Entry, not the LBX File
