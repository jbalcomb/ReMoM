Base Food Level
Each city has a base food level of Food which can be efficiently produced with enough farmers, as follows:
    ½ for each Forest, Hill, or Shore in its catchment area.
    1½ for each Grassland in its catchment area.
    2 for each River, River Mouth¹, or Sorcery Node¹ in its catchment area.
    2½ for each Nature Node¹ in its catchment area.
    The food generated is halved if the terrain tile is shared with another city.
    Terrain tiles with Corruption do not count. However, tiles with unbroken nodes or lairs do count.
    +50% to the above quantities if the city has Gaia's Blessing cast on it.

Do_Player_Colony_Calculations_()
    loops over all colonies, checks owner and outpost status
        the loop over colonies is done by testing that the ptr_colony is not greater than _colony[_NUM_COLONIES]
    calls Pre_Import_Computing_() with pointer to colony
    then Colony_Food2_Per_Farmer_() sets _colony s_COLONY.food2_per_farmer
    after it updates all of the player's colonies
        it calls Do_Player_Colony_Post_Production_()
