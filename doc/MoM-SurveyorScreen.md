SURVEYOR

Clicking on the surveyor button replaces the status window of the main movement screen (see Status Window) with surveyor information (surveyor window).  
By running the mouse cursor over visible map squares on the main movement screen, you can see information about the map squares revealed in the surveyor window.  
The surveyor’s information includes statistics for a potential city built on the selected map square: the potential maximum population of a city built at that site and any bonuses such a city would get to its production and gold revenue because of nearby terrain features.  
The information displayed in the surveyor window also includes the terrain type and any special terrain features (minerals, crystals, wild game, etc.), including their bonus effects on food, gold, power and production.  
See Terrain Types and Terrain Specials for more information on specific terrain types and features.  
Click on the cancel button at the bottom of the surveyor window to exit.
