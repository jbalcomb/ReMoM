The Propose Treaty Option
The first of your diplomatic options, Propose Treaty, lets you ask for agreements that improve your relations with that wizard, or lets you pressure her into degrading her relations with another player.  
Here, we explain the subtleties of getting each proposal accepted, and the exact effect it will have.  

Wizard's Pact
Another wizard will only accept a Wizard's Pact if your current relationship with her is at least +11 DPs on the Diplomatic Relations Scale (i.e., relaxed or better).  

A Wizard's Pact immediately increases your Diplomatic Relations Scale by +20 Diplomacy Points, plus a random + 1 to +3 DPs per turn, subject to the permanent DP modifiers (see Table 25.2).
