Between the two enchantment windows are three areas: the spell information window, the action window and the active unit window.  

The spell information window is devoted to statistical information on your wizard’s spell casting abilities for the current combat.  
· Skill is the total amount of mana that your wizard can use to cast spells for the entire battle.  
· Mana is how much magic power your wizard has in reserve.  
· Range is a distance modifier for the cost of casting spells in battles that are far from the wizard’s enchanted fortress (see Spells in Combat).
