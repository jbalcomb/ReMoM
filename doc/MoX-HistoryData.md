HISTORIAN

Clicking on the historian button takes you to a graph called History of Wizards’ Power.  
This graph shows all known wizards’ power over time.  
The power of a wizard is the combined value of many things including army strength, total magic power drawn from all sources per turn, and spells that wizard has learned.

The History of Wizards’ Power graph also compares your wizard with all known enemy wizards.  
Each wizard’s power is represented by a colored line corresponding to the wizard’s banner-color.  
A key in the upper left corner shows each wizard’s name printed in the same color.  
Click anywhere on the graph to exit this screen.
