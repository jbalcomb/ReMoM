Charismatic gives a wizard a great advantage in all interactions with other wizards, mercenaries, merchants and heroes.  
This ability allows a wizard to purchase artifacts from merchants at half price and to hire mercenaries and heroes at half the usual cost.

Famous doubles the rate at which a wizard is approached by heroes and mercenaries looking for work and by merchants selling valuable artifacts.

MERCHANTS
From time to time, wandering merchants present you with the opportunity to buy powerful artifacts.  
If you agree (click on yes), the gold to buy the artifact is taken from your treasury (gold reserve).  
You are then whisked to the items screen (see Items) with the new artifact, so that you can give it to the appropriate hero or store it in your fortress vault.  
Bear in mind that a Charismatic wizard (see Special Abilities) gets a significant discount on merchantsâ€™ goods!
