Special Abilities

Alchemy allows a wizard to directly interconvert gold and magic power.  
The conversion process normally results in a loss of 50%  
of the starting material (you convert 100 gold into 50 mana).  
With Alchemy, you can convert on a straight one-for-one basis.

If you are short of either mana or gold, you can use the alchemy button
in the items screen to interconvert these two goods. Click on the alchemy
button to get to the conversion screen. See Alchemy for more information.

Magic

The magic summary screen also provides a means  
to communicate with other wizards,  
to obtain information about other wizards,  
to adjust how your magic power is being allocated  
and to use alchemy to interconvert gold and magic power.

ALCHEMY

If you are short of mana or gold, you can interconvert these two resources through the use of alchemy.  
Click on the alchemy button to get to the conversion screen.

Do not, however, recklessly interconvert gold and mana. Unless your
wizard has the special ability of Alchemy (see Special Abilities), all
such conversions result in a loss of half the starting material! That is, if
you convert 100 gold into magic power, you obtain only 50 mana points.

Click on the arrow button between OK and cancel until the direction of the conversion (gold to magic power or magic power to gold) suits your purposes.  
Then click and drag the black and gray arrow in the center of the window until the amount of mana or gold you are converting (called transmuting) is correct.  
Let go of the mouse button and click on the OK button to make the conversion.  
Click on the cancel button to return to the magic summary screen if you change your mind.  
Note that there is also an alchemy button in the items screen (see Armies).  
If you entered the conversion screen from the items screen, you return to the items screen upon exiting.
