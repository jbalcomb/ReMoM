¿ _city_idx ?  

shares with UV/USW  

shares with Production Screen, Enemy City Screen, ...  

¿ whole other business with Cityscape code ?  


naming convention for functions that use module-scoped `_city_idx`?  


ridiculous amount of pre-work

Round 1:  
    NOTHING for 'Cityscape'  
        none of the cityscape draw functions  
        no cityscape fields  
        no cityscape input  
    NOTHING for city enchantments  

¿ road-blocks, hurdles, hang-ups ?

City vs. Outpost  
Own City vs. Enemy City  
Main Screen Unit Window vs. City Screen Garrison Window  
City Screen vs. Production Screen  

City vs. Outpost  
    e.g.,
        could be named
            City_Screen_Add_Fields_City_Enchantments()
        but, also used for 'Outpost /PopUp/'
        so, just named
            City_Add_Fields_City_Enchantments()
        presumes some understanding that "City" includes "City" or "Outpost"

            4x4?

    sanitize bldg_idx_1 {3, ..., 34} ¿ OR >= 100 ?



So, ...
    IDK_completed_bldg_idx is module-scoped to 'City Screen'
    IDK_animate_new_building_idx is module-scoped to 'Cityscape'

City_Remove_Building()
called for selling building or damaging city
sets s_CITY.buildings[] to 2  ¿ "B_Destroyed" ?
so, does *unbuild* it, but *done & gone* ~ sold/destroyed
¿ build building list specifically checks for 0 or 1 ?
¿ anything tests for `> -1` || `>= 0` ?
    Yup.
        City_Screen_Can_Build_List()  `>= 1`


what does it mean to return ST_FALSE?

e.g., cannot sell Sages Guild - Sages Guild required by Alchemists Guild

BASIC UPKEEP INFORMATION
Upkeep Type Notes
Gold To pay normal troops and non-noble heroes
(maintenance cost reduced by wizard’s fame);
To maintain buildings
Food To maintain normal troops (1 food per unit)
Mana To maintain the presence of summoned creatures;
To maintain enchantments and continuous spells


"requisite materials"
"previously constructed buildings"
"requires prior construction"
"replacement buildings"

To sell a building, you can click on it  
  (you only receive half of its construction cost in gold).
The only structures that you cannot sell are fortresses and summoning circles.

Cities can only produce those buildings  
  for which they have the requisite materials (terrain types),  
  previously constructed buildings  
    (for example, construction of a temple requires prior construction of a shrine)  
    and knowledge (race-dependent; see Select Race).  

Cities with shrines, sage’s guilds or animist’s guilds  
(or their replacement buildings)  
use nightshade to automatically cast dispel magic against all city enchantments and global spells directed against the city every turn;
