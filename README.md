# Master of Magic - Reassembled
# ReMoM

Remaking the game ‘Master of Magic’ from 1994-95, all from disassembling the original executables and reassembling and translating it to C.  

The goal of this project is to recreate a functional source code for Master of Magic, to allow the community to improve and expand the Simtex Universe to their hearts content.  

To get involved, or even just hang out with other MoM fans, join us on the the "Master of Magic - Fans" Discord Server.  
This particular project is hosted by the [#mom-reverse-engineering Channel](https://discord.gg/kSNA8bE6Wt), on that server.
